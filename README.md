### Scenario 1

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance. Then we used a function where Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>,  where C<sub>F</sub> represents the cost of fuel, ΔF is the fuel required to complete the trip,  T<sub>best</sub> is the most efficient time, C<sub>T</sub> is the time related cost per minute of flight, and C<sub>c</sub> represents the fixed cost independent of time.

**Objective**: To transport 3000 passengers within a week from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 12 flights. The time cost should also be moderate, and the cost of fuel should be $0.76 per kilogram.

**Results**: The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $85894.42 and $89186.64 per trip, respectively. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Airbus 330neo would be the best option for the scenario.

### Scenario 2

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance. Then we used a function where Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>,  where C<sub>F</sub> represents the cost of fuel, ΔF is the fuel required to complete the trip,  T<sub>best</sub> is the most efficient time, C<sub>T</sub> is the time related cost per minute of flight, and C<sub>c</sub> represents the fixed cost independent of time.

**Objectives**: To transport 1250 passengers within this month from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 5.The time cost should be high, and the cost of fuel should be $0.88 per kilogram.

**Results**: The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $49191.80 and $45168.54 per trip, respectively. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Airbus 350neo would be the best option for the scenario.

### Scenario 3

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance.

**Objectives**: To transport 2500 passengers within this week from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 25.The time cost should be low, and the cost of fuel should be $0.95 per kilogram.

**Results**: The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $84267.23 and $85552.68 per trip, respectively.

## Task 2
**Goal**: To design a new cost area that can reduce the cost of the route.

**Background**: There are certain areas called jet-streams where aircraft could consume relatively less fuel. Jet streams are formed when warm air masses meet cold air masses in the atmosphere. Although, flying with the jet-stream would be quicker and more fuel-efficient. However if the aircraft arrives too early, circling on a holding patter over the airspace is not ideal. In contrast, if the jet stream is weak, flying against it would need more fuel and slow the aircraft down, perhaps resulting in delays. In this task we will aim to create a scenario where we can use the jet stream to our advantage in-order better grasp the concept of flight planning.

**Methodology**: Taking the scenario from [Task 1](#task-1) as a background, we had to find the best place to set the jet stream where the cost of the flight is reduced by 5%. The recommended parameters are that the jet stream region stretch across the map laterally and span 5-units vertically.


**Results**: 

![ezgif com-gif-maker (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116061877/200550990-c1e6800d-d076-4813-be21-ff3ba1aaaa21.gif)


**Coding**:

![IMG-20221115-WA0011](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/202359542-d97b9104-49c1-48ca-9c13-50e9b718d0ab.jpg)

At this part, we add a new area, a jet stream area. Understanding that aircraft's path will be only between somewhere around 10 and 50(Those values are not exact, but very close), we have managed the x range between 10 and 49. Meanwhile, i is in range -10 till 60, which is probably the whole horizontal range of the map, we have managed the range of j as x and x+5 since the jet stream's size was only 5 points, where x is some uknown for us constant, so code should consider the whole pointed area for the most effective place to suit this stream. 

The last part of coding:

" if x==10:
   lowest = costpath
   bestx = x"

We make coding to start from coordinate 10, calculating a new costpath as the lowest one, and making this x, which is 10, as the best coordinate. Continuing, we have added the next part:

"if costpath < lowest:
   lowest = costpath
   bestx = x"
   
Here we just make the programme to calculate all possible values of x and comparing all costpath with each other, for finding the best x value. The new and hence final x value we mention as bestx for our further calculations. 

![IMG-20221115-WA0012](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/202359563-2667faf4-3fb6-4e07-82d9-8d3c5f02d860.jpg)

Evene if the previous codes probably calculate the best x value and hence the best area for fitting jet stream area, the code itself will not work, since it will take only the first value x, which is 10, and put it in all formulas without consideration of other values. It is why we have to add this part to make it elaborate. At that part, we mention j range from bestx and bestx+5 that are revealed from previous code, so now it is chooses best area for et stream basing on best x value.

![IMG-20221115-WA0013](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/202359649-d8b52aa5-c71e-4d18-9b4d-a004f1dabca9.jpg)

Even though, just adding codes will not make programme work since we have not put js_x and js_y with x at the "a_star" and "rx, ry, costapth" content in the code. Without putting them, programme could not proceed all calculations at the output since it has no such command. hHowever, changing this part which is showed in the screenshot, we make coding to include jet-stream too in the whole process.

## Task 3
**Goal**: To design a new aircraft model that achieves minimum costs for the specific scenarios in [Task1](#task-1).

**Trend**: According to the fuel price analysis, the fuel cost in 2022 had increased a total of 73.7% compared to 2021 which indicated that jumbo jets like B747 or A380 should not be considered in this task.

**Results**: The aircraft B797 using twin RR Trent 1000 engine is the best fit for scenario 1 in task 1 as this aircraft is able to meet the cost specification between A321 & A330. The targetted no of flights is 11 with 273 passengers per flight.


A potential design for the aircraft

![b797-main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116061877/201460210-70e0f01d-554d-414a-a875-baadc2b19493.jpg)


**Calculation**: Refering to the formula Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>, We have found that the total cost approximates to $69375.13 which is much lower than the cost for an A330neo. Meanwhile, the capacity of newly designed aircraft, B797, is 273 passengers. Allowing us to exploit twin-engine aircraft, flying 11 flights weekly. Having a table of fuel price, we have noted that bbl was mainly used there, it is why we used this website, "https://www.convertunits.com/from/barrel+%5bUS,+liquid%5d/to/kilo+gram#:~:text=Quick%20conversion%20chart%20of%20barrel%20%5BUS%2C%20liquid%5D%20to,liquid%5D%20to%20kilo%20gram%20%3D%20238.48094%20kilo%20gram", for converting barrels to kilograms for further calculations in coding

![Task 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/201460707-bde85a28-0aa7-467f-ab65-3ceca6e30986.jpg)


**Reasons Behind**: By comparing other existing aircraft which may be possible candidates for this role such as the A321, A330, A340, A350 and the B787. We determined that an aircraft with a moderate seating capacity and twin-engine layout would be the most efficient. As such we designed our aircraft to have a capacity between the A330-200 (250 seats) and the b787-9 (296 seats), so our group initially assumed that an aircraft with a 275-seating capacity will expend the lowest possible cost. A twin-engine design was favoured due to examing the efficency of the A340 and A350, one had an inefficient quad engine layout whiles the other had a very efficent twin engine layout which help boost its overall appeal. As such it was an easy decision on which engine configuration to choose. To solidify our assumption, our group has written a code that calculates whether we need a twin-engine or 4-engine aircrfat with its capacity and operational cost. Hence we have designed our aircraft the B797 to follow our setout guidelines and to comply with the guidelines of the task.

**Coding**:

![IMG-20221115-WA0014](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/202359677-9eea788e-3ec3-43e5-b214-b0bd23ba06b7.jpg)

This part of coding is just a list of constant for future calculations that will be made. Taking scenario 1 from task 1, our newly designed aircraft should carry 3000 passengers in a week, with maximum number of flights of 12. We have, also, input other constants such as CT and CF for both twin and 4 engine aircrafts, but the most vital part is the "usdbbl". Looking at provided table, we have taken a value for Asia and Oceania Region since this region is more actual than others for us. 

![IMG-20221115-WA0015](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/202359695-74d42f47-2578-493b-bcd8-8019764de541.jpg)

This part is the most essential for completing Task 3. Firstly, we have written a formula for converting from usd per barrel to cost for fuel in terms of kilograms since further calculations should include exactly kilograms, but not barrels. Next two formulas of "m" and "N" are responsible for adding additional costs for every 50 passengers and  revealing the total number of flights, which will not be changed in further, respectively. Both values are rounded to the next number by code "math.ceil".

Continuing the code, we can note that there are two possible outcomes of Total_cost, where one of them is for twin-engine aircraft, while the second one is for 4-engine and from now, the most interesting part starts:

"if passengers==250:
   lowest = Total_cost
   bestpassengers = passengers"

Here we make the code start to calculate the most cheapest value and the best type of aircraft in terms of engine by itself. Starting from the lowest number of passenegrs, 250, code makes the Total_cost of 250 people as the lowest and bestpassengers, number of passengers that suits much more for our case, as 250.
The second part of the code:

"if Total_cost < lowest:
   lowest = Total_cost
   bestpassengers = passengers"
In this part, we make the code search the most reliable results of both costs and number of passengers by itself by comparing all values and choosing the most effective one. 

![IMG-20221115-WA0016](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116084608/202359709-08e7948e-25c2-4de2-9bdf-c02044a4f821.jpg)

This formula is pretty similar with formulas in task 1 and 2, but here the coding can give either one of the solution which is probably describes all information that is needed. Already calculating the best number of passengers, the code proceeds its further calculation of the Total_cost of our new aircraft, by checking in which condition the capacity suits more. The part "if bestpassengers >= 300" makes coding to choose which type of new aircraft we should use to minimize our costs. If a new aircraft's capacity is higher, then coding print name of a new aircraft, the number of engines that it should possess, and the cost that it requires for operation. Moreover, it, also, prints the number of seats that is needed for the aircraft to fulfill requirements. Otherwise, if the number of passengers is lower than 300, as in our case, it swicthes to twin-engine aircraft, showing its passenger capacity and operational cost.

## Reflections
**Yerlan's Reflection:**   If truth be told, I was scared to start compulsory coding assignments of Astar planning since I was a newcomer for coding at all. However, after starting the project, it did not seem so unachievable anymore even though I have spent a lot of my time for those assignments. During each on and off session times, I, always, learnt something new about python in visual studio. Let's take task 1 for example. When I started do it, I realized that most of the part of coding here is just changing values by your logic, while a whole of my life I believed that any project that we start to do, we have to write each code by yourself. It was one of the reasons why I was afraid even to start it before in my life. Furthermore, there were parts where I was needed to write a code by myself from the beginning, an autonomous calculation of cost of each type of airbus, but it was as simply as general math equations. Just input some constant values and write the formula for them. After finishing of all 3 compulsory coding tasks, I have finally found some logic in python through the pain and tears. Even more, I just started to love it. During the GitHub project I have not only learnt coding, but I have also revealed some new aviation terms that bother me currently. Starting task 2, I was so confused about jet stream. As I have never heard about jet stream term before in my life, I did not even understand the task fully. Spending some time on reading separate articles and watching videos about those jet streams, I finally understood that, continuing completing a task with a new knowledge. 

At the same time, it was the first time for me when I was a leader of a serious group project and managed groupmates with their tasks. During the first week of GitHub project, everyone was so quiet, so I came to the decision that I should take the role of being leader. We all understand that success of the results mainly depends on a leader, who should divide tasks and choose correct person for this task wisely. Moreover, understanding that none of my fellow groupmates can code, I decided to split up other tasks of GitHub to small groups of people, so everyone could work on the project. Giving them their tasks, I also set up the deadlines, so I could control the whole process and understand will we finish it at time or not. 

To sum up, having GitHub project just did not teach me some basic concepts in coding and aviation, but also enhanced my leadership skills. After finishing all tasks, it can sound weird, but I am eager to start a new GitHub project with the team, trying all my soft and coding skills in solving issues that face current aviation. Even though it could be impossible, I have a willing to start learning coding more deeply, and I will do some courses during my winter break! The last but not least, the most essential part I think, I found new good friends from my cohort with whom I can easily start talking at any time!


**Namnet's Reflection:** 


**Hang's Reflection:** 


**Frederick's Reflection:** 


**Jophy's Reflection:**     As I was majorly focus on the calculations part in Task 1 and Task 3, as well as deciding the type of aircraft we would like to design, this project really opened my eyes up on the algorithms behind the aviation industry in order to strive for profit maximization due to the skyrocketting fuel price and meeting the market demand. It was never an easy task to decide the best aircraft for the route due to all sorts of constraints, let alone designing a new aircraft that will fit the exsisting market. In the project our group has discussed a lot on whether a smaller twin-engine aircraft or a larger quad-engine aircraft will best fit this scenario we are given as well as the future trends in the world of aviation.
Thus, we are able to optimize the cost and the revenue of each flight as it can have a significant impact an an airline's financial state and sustainability.  Morover, this project also equipped me the basics on coding which this area is vitally important to the future development of the aviation industry regarding safety and profit-making. Being an aviation enthusiast since a young age, I have tried several airline managing games in the past and I used to spend quite a lot of effort on the calculations of each flight using in-game statistics. Those experiences really bring me an upper hand in this project and I am looking forward to apply those knowledge acquired from the project into my future career.
  However, from my recent obserations and researches, the parameters that appeared in the project are not the only parameters that affect the final decisions of airline choosing which aircraft for the specific route due to other market concerns. For example, the A350 and B777 series have a much wider body which can equip a more spacious, luxurious and cutting-edge first-class products to receive a higher ticketting revenue whilst enhancing its brand value. LLCs usually have an air fleet consist of one or few types of aircrafts only in order to minimise its staff training and maintenance parts cost which makes them have fewer choice on the aircraft selection for specific routes compare to major cities' flag carriers. This already involving considerations in not only engineering but also marketing and human resources.
  I really enjoy being part of this project and helping with the calculations involved in the codes. Once again I am so grateful for all the hardwork everyone has done in this project.
