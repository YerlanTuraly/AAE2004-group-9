## About the project

As efficiency in cost and passanger satisfaction are a crucial factor that determines the sucess of airlines. This project is primarily focused on finding the most an efficeint pathway for a flight under various realworld circumstances using technologies and methods that are easily acessible.

## Task 1
**Goal**: To find an appropriate aircraft model that can achieve minimum cost for each given scenario. 

This is the most efficent flight plan that our group has formulated.

### Senario 1

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance. Then we used a function where Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>,  where C<sub>F</sub> represents the cost of fuel, ΔF is the fuel required to complete the trip,  T<sub>best</sub> is the most efficient time, C<sub>T</sub> is the time related cost per minute of flight, and C<sub>c</sub> represents the fixed cost independent of time.

**Objective**: To transport 3000 passengers within a week from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 12 flights. The time cost should also be moderate, and the cost of fuel should be $0.76 per kilogram.

**Results**: The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $85894.42 and $89186.64 per trip, respectively. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Airbus 330neo would be the best option for the scenario.

### Senario 2

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance. Then we used a function where Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>,  where C<sub>F</sub> represents the cost of fuel, ΔF is the fuel required to complete the trip,  T<sub>best</sub> is the most efficient time, C<sub>T</sub> is the time related cost per minute of flight, and C<sub>c</sub> represents the fixed cost independent of time.

**Objectives**: To transport 1250 passengers within this month from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 5.The time cost should be high, and the cost of fuel should be $0.88 per kilogram.

**Results**: The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $49191.80 and $45168.54 per trip, respectively. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Airbus 350neo would be the best option for the scenario.

### Senario 3

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance. Then we used a function where Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>,  where C<sub>F</sub> represents the cost of fuel, ΔF is the fuel required to complete the trip,  T<sub>best</sub> is the most efficient time, C<sub>T</sub> is the time related cost per minute of flight, and C<sub>c</sub> represents the fixed cost independent of time.

**Objectives**: To transport 2500 passengers within this week from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 25.The time cost should be low, and the cost of fuel should be $0.95 per kilogram.

**Results**: The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $84267.23 and $85552.68 per trip, respectively. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Airbus 330neo would be the best option for the scenario.

## Task 3
**Goal**: To design a new aircraft model that achives minimum costs for the specific scenarios in [Task1](#task-1).

**Trend**: According to the fuel price analysis, the fuel cost in 2022 had increased a total of 73.7% compare to 2021 which indicated that jumbo jets like B787 or A380 should not be considered in this task.

**Results**: B797 using twin RR Trent 1000 engine is the best to fit scenario 1 in task 1 as this aircraft is able to fit the cost specification between A321 & A330. The targetted no of flights is 11 with 275 passengers per flight.

**Calculation**: Refer to to the formula Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>, We have found the total cost approximately to $65682.10 which is much lower than the cost for A330neo.

**Reasons Behind**: Compare to three other aircrafts types A321neo, A330neo and A350. the passenger capacity of A321neo is only 200 which is not enough. Also, both A330neo and A350 are four engine aircrafts. As the fuel price had rised significantly, it is clear that the efficency of both aircraft is low. Therefore, only B797 should be considered in this task.
