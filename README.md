## About the project

As efficiency in cost and passanger satisfaction are a crucial factor that determines the sucess of airlines. This project is primarily focused on finding the most an efficeint pathway for a flight under various realworld circumstances using technologies and methods that are easily acessible.

## Task 1
**Goal**: To find an appropriate aircraft model that can achieve minimum cost for each given scenario. 

This is the most efficent flight plan that our group has formulated.

### Senario 1

**Methodology**: We first setup our obstacles and cost intensive areas, which represent physical or environmental barriers and areas that should be avoided to maximize performance. Then we used a function where Cost(C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>,  where C<sub>F</sub> represents the cost of fuel, ΔF is the fuel required to complete the trip,  T<sub>best</sub> is the most efficient time, C<sub>T</sub> is the time related cost per minute of flight, and C<sub>c</sub> represents the fixed cost independent of time.

**Objective**: To transport 3000 passengers within a week from the the start point to end point, while adhering to a number of objectives, such as the weekly flight cap of 12 flights. The time cost should also be moderate, and the cost of fuel should be $0.76 per kilogram.

**Results**:

The program calculated the time required to fly the proposed flight path. The rest of the calculation was also rechecked using the Cost function (C) = C<sub>F</sub>· ΔF · T<sub>best</sub> + C<sub>T</sub> . T<sub>best</sub> +C<sub>c</sub>.  and comparing the performance and between two widebody airliners the Airbus 330neo and Airbus350-900 which came out to be approximately $85894.42 and $89186.64 per trip, respectively. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Airbus 330neo would be the best option for the scenario.
